Makes 12-15 servings

Ingredients

350g unsifted flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 tsp salt
225g butter
175g caster sugar
175g soft brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 eggs
350g dark chocolate, crumbled

Preparation

Preheat the oven to 190C/Gas 5.
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt.
In another bowl, combine the butter, sugar, brown sugar and vanilla extract until creamy. Beat in the eggs. Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate.

Split the pliable dough into two halves, rolling each out into sausage shapes, approximately 5cm/2in in diameter. Wrap them in cling film and transfer to the refrigerator until ready to use.
When you are ready to bake the cookies, simply cut the log into slices 2cm thick and lay on a baking tray, widely spaced apart.

Bake for 9-11 minutes.

Serve.
